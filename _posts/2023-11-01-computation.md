In the early stages of human communication, we relied on speech to convey our thoughts and ideas. However, this method was often imprecise, making it challenging to truly grasp the intended meaning when using abstract terms like "honor," "skill," "love," or "religion." Philosophers like Socrates emphasized this issue, frequently frustrating those he engaged with by questioning the precise meaning behind their words.

Fast forward to the 17th century, when the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution ushered in a new, more precise way to describe the natural world. This transition marked a shift from the oral tradition to the "numerical" tradition, from verbal descriptions to mathematical equations. This transformation was groundbreaking, offering vast new possibilities and driving significant progress. However, it also revealed its limitations, particularly when dealing with complex systems.

The third transformation in our understanding of the natural world began around the 1940s, known as the computational paradigm. Stephen Wolfram's captivating book, "A New Kind of Science," introduced the idea that complex behavior doesn't necessarily require complex rules, dispelling the intuition that intricate systems demand intricate instructions. Cellular Automata, for instance, vividly demonstrate that complexity can emerge from simple rules, and achieving Turing completeness is surprisingly straightforward.

Wolfram also introduced the concept of "computational irreducibility," which means that for some systems, you can't predict an outcome without going through the actual computationâ€”no shortcuts are available. Wolfram is currently engaged in a project to explore the computational universe in search of the rules that may have generated our universe, and he has made significant progress in this endeavor.

Mining the computational universe is a fascinating concept. While most computations may seem useless from a human perspective, some can be immensely valuable. Human intelligence is one way to delve into the computational universe, and machine learning is another. Machine learning serves as a tool to venture deep into the computational realm, seeking programs that can map inputs (as defined by us) to outputs (also defined by us). This approach, referred to as "Software 2.0" by Andrej Karpathy, differs from the manual search for functions in "Software 1.0."

This new computational perspective opens up exciting possibilities for tackling complex systems, offering a fresh lens through which to view the world.

Fundamentally, computation involves following precise steps, making it a simple and well-defined concept. Based on this, "knowing something completely" can be defined as the ability to express it in terms of computation. Following this definition, we can claim to "understand" chess because we can create a computer program that plays chess effectively, but we don't yet understand intelligence in the same way.

Machine Learning introduces a new dimension to our understanding. It creates a spectrum between tasks like chess, which we can fully comprehend and code from scratch, and intelligence, which remains beyond our direct grasp.

Consider image recognition as an example. We struggle to write a traditional algorithm that can reliably detect objects like chairs in an image. However, neural networks excel at this task. We can create a neural network that knows how to perform object detection, even though we can't easily express the solution directly in code.

In summary, there are three categories of knowledge:

Category 1: Fully understood - We can code it from scratch.
Category 2: Pragmatically understood - We can code something that generates its code from scratch.
Category 3: Not understood - We can't represent it in code at all.
Chess falls into Category 1, object detection falls into Category 2, and intelligence resides in Category 3.

An intriguing question arises concerning the theory of knowledge itself: Are there concepts that necessarily belong to only one category?
